Here I will show you how to get custom colours in the program.    
The colours are in HEX value, RGB and others won't work.
To start of, find four colours that you want (in HEX value) then follow the steps bellow.

1. Open color_palettes.py (not pyc) (you must have Python installed and some Python knowledge required)

2. Find the lists called:  color_palettes AND color_palettes_names.

3. In color_palettes, add a new list and fill it in like the others with your own HEX colour codes. (remember to add a comma to the end of the previous list)

4. In color_palettes_names, add a new line and a new string and call it whatever you want the name of your group of colours to be. (remember to add a comma to the end of the previous lines)

5. Save and run the program .

6. If it works, repeat as many times as you want.

BONUS: If the instructions worked for you, you can add more than four colours for each palette.

1. Go to the color_palettes variable and add a new string and put in a new HEX code (remember a comma)   NOTE: Might not look the best graphically in the program.

2. Save and run.
